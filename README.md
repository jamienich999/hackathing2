Things to remember:
* Can't sign up... have to create account with Google (need to fix)
* Once you sign in with Google, you'll have to set your own password (using the set/reset password button)
* Do we want to make a separate page for account creation?
* Not sure if it blocks non-existent emails... might need account verification?
