Things to remember:
* To run: either install Live Server on VSCode, right click index.html, and then click 'Run with Live Server'
  * There's a way to do it with Python but need to look it up
* Can't sign up... have to create account with Google (need to fix)
* Once you sign in with Google, you'll have to set your own password (using the set/reset password button)
* Do we want to make a separate page for account creation?
* Not sure if it blocks non-existent emails... might need account verification?
